# Spoonflower Challange

## Project Description

In this project I built an app that uses an API to access Spoonflowers Marketplace.
I used Node.js, Express node packege, and body parser Middleware to use HTTP routes and request and to effectively connect to a local server.
In order to run this app on your local machine you would need to type "node server.js" command from the terminal and open localhost:3000 on the browser.

Upon loading the page the app will dynimically build the HTML elements that hold the design cards according to the page size. The user can then search for terms and sort by product type, catergory, colors, and style.

The navigation header contain links that lead to more sections in the app as "How it Works" section, "Work with Us" section and "Join us section" with sign up form. Some of the links in the footer and inside the container will lead to external Spoonflower sources.
